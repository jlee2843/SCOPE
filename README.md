# Stabilized COre gene and Pathway Election
**Presenter**: Jenny Lee  |  **Supervisor**: Pathum Kossinna  |  **Collaborator**: Dr. Cai 
<br>Implementing the SCOPE algorithm on GSE98394 dataset. This research project was funded by **Alberta Innovates** in 2022 under the supervision of [Dr.Zhang's Lab in Biostatistics & Health Data Science](https://sites.google.com/site/qingrunzhang/home?authuser=0). 

## Project Roadmap
- SCOPE-Stabilized LASSO Regression (bootstrapped LASSO regression)
- Co-expression analysis and differential co-expression analysis
- Pathway Enrichment with Over Representation Analysis

## Dataset
- Retrieved from NCBI: [Gene Expression Omnibus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE98394). 
- Contains transcriptome data of 78 treatment-naive melanocytic tumor patients. The patients' stage of cancer varies from benign (common acquired nevus) to malignant (primary melanoma).
